# Failora

A distributed time server election algorithm based on response latency and response rate under high traffic in previous elections. Currently in progress.

## Todo

- Unit tests (functions, algorithms)
- Priority voting
- Handling time requests after the time server ends its period
- New time server election participation rate and time cap
- Creating a local simulation
